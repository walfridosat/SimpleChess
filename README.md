# SimpleChess

Very inefficient chess game (will be a bot soon) ported to webassembly via pygbag

Heavily inspired by [Sebastian Lague's video of coding adverntures!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk)

You can play it online at [my personal website](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~wsn/) (altough i dont garantee it'll be up to date lol)

# Usage steps:

1. Install pygame, pygbag and asyncio with pip.

2. Open the terminal one directory above the project (type "cd .." if you're at main.py) and use "python -m pygbag SimpleChess", the project will compile at a folder called "build" and a localhost will appear on the terminal.
